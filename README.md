### Hi there, I'm [Josh Hong](https://Joshhong30s.github.io) ðŸ‘‹

I am a Frontend Developer with hands-on experience in **Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. 

My journey into coding started when I decided to build a website for my family. I relied on online resources and persistent practice to acquire my coding skills, which was both challenging and rewarding. Now, I'm eager to contribute my skills to meaningful web development projects.

In addition to my coding skills, I'm a seasoned B2B sales executive with a decade of experience in the technology/software industry. I have honed my communication, problem-solving, and project management skills over 10 years, and I am adept at collaborating with diverse teams.

**I'm currently open to web developer/frontend/fullstack roles, and I'm always ready for new challenges. Feel free to get in touch if you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat**!

Here are some of the recent projects I've been working on:

- **May 2023**: Created a photo gallery website for my newborn baby and my family, using NextJS, React, TypeScript, Tailwind css, and MongoDB. I developed a user-friendly interface for photo uploads by integrating ImgurAPI, Express, and MongoDB. This website has been a joy for my family, allowing them to easily share and view photos.

- **April 2023**: Developed a dashboard to visualize GoogleSheets data for coffee managers using NextJS, React, TypeScript, Tailwind css. I built a dynamic dashboard with client data fetching and server data fetching, using Next.js API route and getServerSideProps. This dashboard has helped managers to monitor and improve their operations. [[website]](https://03dashboard.vercel.app/)
- **March 2023**: Designed and built my personal website and dev blog using React. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my projects and a platform to share my coding journey and insights. [[website]](https://joshhong.vercel.app/)
